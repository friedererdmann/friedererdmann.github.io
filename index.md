Hi there,

my name’s Frieder. Currently I’m working as Lead Technical Artist on the Snowdrop Engine Team at Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio in Malmo, Sweden. Prior to that I worked on games such as Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 as an embedded Senior Technical Artist.

Before moving to Sweden, I worked at Crytek (Frankfurt, Germany), where I served as Product Manager for FilmEngine (or Cinebox) after many years of being a Cinematic Designer and Technical Artist in the Creative Services Department.

My career started at the motion capture facility and cinematics outsourcing studio Metricminds (Frankfurt, Germany), where I worked as a Cinematic Artist.

Throughout my career I have been lucky enough to work on a number of successful games, as well as being able to contribute to the virtual production and previs of movies and animated content.

Before working full-time in the industry I studied Digital Media (B.A.) at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt. I wrote my Bachelor’s thesis on the potential of real-time visualization for movie pre-visualization.

If you’d like to get in touch, please reach out through LinkedIn.
